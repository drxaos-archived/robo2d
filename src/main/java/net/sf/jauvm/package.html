Provides the core classes that implement the JauVM.
<p/>
The most important classes are the {@link net.sf.jauvm.Interpreter Interpreter} and the {@link net.sf.jauvm.Continuation
Continuation} classes, and the {@link net.sf.jauvm.interpretable interpretable} annotation:
<ul>
    <li>the {@link net.sf.jauvm.Interpreter Interpreter} class implements the core JauVM bytecode interpreter, besides
        being the frameworks' main class.</li>
    <li>the {@link net.sf.jauvm.Continuation Continuation} class represents a serializable JauVM continuation
        object.</li>
    <li>the {@link net.sf.jauvm.interpretable interpretable} annotation is used to tag methods to be interpreted,
        similarly to the {@code native} keyword for native methods.</li>
</ul>
